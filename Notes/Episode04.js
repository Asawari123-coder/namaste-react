Steps : When you build any project then we have to follow steps as below
1. Planning
    a. Header
        -Logo 
        -Nav Items (links)
    b. Body
        - Search Bar
        - Card Container

        - Links
        - Address
        - Contact
- Make Reusable component
Part 02
- How can we pass data to dynamically to component then we will pass props as known as properties
- passing argument to function just like passing props to component
- JSON Viewer plugin
- Config driven UI : Controlling your UI using data and that data and config comes from backend 
Example : Swiggy , different locations same UI, like Delhi have different Carousel data 
Should have knowledge of API ?
Why are you sending this data ?
UI is powered by data.
React application => UI layer => data layer both makes application
Best Practices of writing our code
Code Reviewing code
- Cleaning mess
* Always make habit when you are going to use map or looping anything then must give key.
why ?
because when any item added in th list then react did not which one is new one so react will render all
items. if you provide a key then it renders only new one item.
using array index as bad practice
use unique id as key 

Summary
1. Planning 
2. Make it static 
3. Make it dynamic
4. Use key as unique id as key 
5. Clean your mess
