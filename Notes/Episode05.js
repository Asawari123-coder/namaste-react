    #Best Practices
    1. Don't write code in single file. Make small code in one particular file
    2. Folder structure : src
    3. Make separate file for each component.
    4. Always use file extension .js and while importing no need to add extension
    5. Never ever use hard coded data and put it into mockData.js in separate file
    6. Should not exceed more than 100 lines in each file
    7. Keep it your component small
    

    There are 2 types of export import
    1. Default export import
    2. Named export import 

    Default export import 
    syntax :  export default component_name / variable_name
    import Component_name from 'file'
    In file only one default export 

    Named import export 
     Suppose you have to use multiple exports in same file then you can use named export 
    syntax : export variable name :  declaration
    import { variable_name } from 'file name'; : usage
